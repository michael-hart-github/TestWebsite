JavaScript can also do things like display moving animations on a webpage, or have specific events like "onclick" or "onhover" for specific events. JavaScript is loaded within <script> tags, or included remotely via <script src="/location/of/javascript_file.js"></script>


<!-- See an example of JavaScript in action -->

</body>

If you have a field that accepts input, and you can use something like h1 to display text on the website without any form of checking or sanitization, it means that HTML can be injected directly into the website. Never to trust user input. Sanitize everything
<!-- Example of input injection issue -->
<script>
    function sayHi() {

        document.getElementById("welcome-msg").innerHTML = "Welcome " + name
    }
