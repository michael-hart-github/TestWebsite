## index.html to old_index.html

I changed index.html to old_index.html after the presenter was about to delete a lot of the stuff we had learned at 1:33:05

## index.html to old_index2.html

I didn't mark the time, but same deal. He wanted to delete a bunch of stuff we were working on, so I made a backup of what we did.

## index.html to old_index3.html

Take a wild guess. It was around 2:10:00, maybe a minute or two before that.
